# Map Rendering Test Results

## Fixed Issues:

1. **MapContainer Isolation**: Each map now has unique keys and class names
   - Dashboard map: `key="dashboard-map-unique"` with class `.dashboard-map-container`
   - Trip planner map: `key="trip-planner-map-unique"` with class `.trip-planner-map-container`

2. **Leaflet CSS Import**: Moved to main.jsx to prevent multiple imports

3. **Icon Configuration**: Fixed default icon paths for both components

4. **Container Styling**: Added proper CSS for map containers with z-index isolation

5. **Lifecycle Management**: Added proper cleanup and invalidateSize calls

## How to Test:

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   cd D:\VoltRoute\server
   npm start
   ```

2. Start the client in another terminal:
   ```bash
   cd D:\VoltRoute
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Navigate to dashboard - Map should be visible with charging stations
4. Navigate to trip planner - Map should be visible for route planning
5. Switch between pages - Both maps should work independently

## Expected Behavior:

- **Dashboard Map**: Shows user location + nearby charging stations
- **Trip Planner Map**: Shows route planning with source/destination markers
- **No Conflicts**: Maps should not interfere with each other when switching pages

## Troubleshooting:

If maps still don't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Leaflet CSS is loading
3. Check if location services are enabled
4. Ensure server is running for station data

## Key Changes Made:

- Unique keys for MapContainer components
- Proper CSS isolation with z-index
- Single Leaflet CSS import
- Enhanced cleanup effects
- Better ref handling
